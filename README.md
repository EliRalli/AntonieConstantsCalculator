# AntonieConstantsCalculator
Python program to calculate the Antonie Constants of various chemicals
The purpose of this program is to use the attacthed excel sheet to calculate the Antoine constants of particular chemicals.
The attached excel sheet was created from Elliot and Lira, from the book Introductory Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics.
The user would enter the chemical from the list and when prompted by the popup would enter the temperature in celcius.
The program then matches the correct numbers for the given chemical and calculates the vapor pressure with the constants.
